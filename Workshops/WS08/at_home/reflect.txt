1.	What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
Abstract base classes are declared but not yet defined.  In this lab, virtual functions were used where they were declared in iAccount but defined in its derived classes. 


2.	Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?
Account::credit is shadowed by ChequingAccount::credit
Account::debit is shadowed by ChequingAccount::debit



3.	Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
I have learned more indepth on hierarchies and how functions can be effectively shared by base classes to derived classes.  I have learned how shadowing is implemented to ensure the hierarchy is not known to client code.  I understand how derived classes can use member functions of their base class as well as add their own member functions.  I learned the logic behind using queries such as Account::balance() as to allow derived functions to access the private member function current_balance.
