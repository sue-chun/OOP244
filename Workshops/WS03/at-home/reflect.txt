3. I have learned some new logic on how to add alternating numbers, creating array from an integer input and creating a new array to store the alternating numbers for summing.  I have also learned to keep track of different arrays and their purposes when typing out the year and balance owing/refund due.  I also learned how to use set.precision in making sure the output has 2 decimal places as required in the lab instructions.
